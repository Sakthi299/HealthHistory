## Problem Statement 
* Medical History of an individual is primary upon Diagnosis of his/her Health discomfort.
* But the quick retrieval of the patientâ€™s health records is challenging as of their treatment can be facilitated by various hospital management sectors. 
* Usually retrieving a patientâ€™s information through database can be maintained within the group of private hospitals.
* But patients typically have data stored in a variety of locations where they receive care. Getting that data in another location seems difficult.              
* Quick assistance is needed in patientâ€™s emergency cases and if we can provide that inevitable information in high time, the treatment can be lot more easier.

## Objective
* An application to store massive medical records in a secure cloud database & retrieving the medical records by Quick Response code will be quick and widely acceptable.
* This system can provide physicians with fast and more comprehensive access to patientsâ€™ medical info in times of crisis.
* This in turn reduce administrative burden and assist doctors in a effective drug prescription.
* In real time, these systems are cost effective and integration of the application is feasible in real world.
